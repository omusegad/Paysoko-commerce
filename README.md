## About Paysoko commerce

This project integrates a Laravel backend with a Next.js frontend, focusing on user authentication, cart functionality, and order management. The backend leverages Redis for caching and session storage, while the frontend provides a modern, responsive user interface for managing orders, login, registration, and cart operations.

## Technologies Used
Backend (Laravel):
Laravel (PHP Framework)

Redis (for caching and session management)

MySQL (for database storage)

Redis CLI (for Redis operations)

## Frontend (Next.js):

Next.js (React Framework)

Tailwind CSS (for styling)
